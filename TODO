** TODO :

- playlist load/save

- improve API to get information about currently played sound

+ controllers (joystick and keyboard) in separate thread

- VMU console

+ recall and line editor for shell

+ lua binding to get driver informations

- lua binding to get song informations and play new songs

- calling d-tor

- add BUGS to cvs

+ Fix stereo bugs
  (2002/09/21 ben) I was probably really tired when I wrote this code. It seems
  to be fixed right now. Since I don't have a stereo output here, I can't
  really test it !!!

+ Load playlist
  (2002/09/20 ben) For m3u only.

- Load .pls playlist

- Save playlist

- cd() command should verify if the path exist and is a dir.

+ md() command can't handle relatif path, can it ? --> OK

- Look at the face-border rendering. Sometime some borders seem to be shifted.
	--> VP : I think this is the border texture itself which is wrong ...

- Japanese support (encoding / display)

+ Remove .gz for file detection
  (2002/09/21 ben) Extensions are properly discard in songmenu.c. It removes
  double extension `.xxx.gz' when building a music name.
  Input drivers that handle gzip loading, must add a new `.xxx.gz' extension
  for each `.xxx' handled. This could make the extension list a little longer
  specially for mikmod which handles lotsa.
  The inp_driver_list_search_by_extension() function must not be given an
  extension from filetype_ext() function because it does not handle properly
  .gz extension.

- Just a idea for later : Karaoke mode with jumping ball...

+ Change info in inp plugin API. It is such a mess.
  [2002-09-27 10:32:34 AM, ben]
  Done ! 

- Ignore joypad move when awaking browser display

- Don't make browser sleep when no visual ( or music playing ? )

- check sndstream functions parameters (frq, vol ... )

- Correct bug of hilight (see BUGS)

- Correct time bug. I Don't really remember what is the bug. Sommething like
  time is not ressetted when changing track in the same file (sc68/playsid).

- Encoding support : e.g Chris Huelsbeck

- Clipping !!! At least for the text window ! A scroller should be nice  when
  text becomes to long.

- Better support for multi track. Think to a supported-features flag in inp API
  and a get_tracks() function.

- File selected is desactivated when reload plugin (side effects of previous
  bug correction for filetype)

- Bug : Lock when killing app too earlier (e.g. while initializing ZED)

  Test TODO auto dating.

  zed removes empty dir when writting a file which name is an empty dir.
  It could happen because unlinking a empty dir is a valid op.
  zed *MUST* check the file/dir type before unlinking.

  [2002-09-26 03:16:32 PM, zig] 
  "zed *MUST* check", or "the filesystem *MUST* check" ?

+ [2002-09-26 04:02:59 AM, ben]
  Question ?
  Why display_driver is shutdown and initialized when loading a new driver of
  an other type (inp or vis) ?

  [2002-09-26 03:15:27 PM, zig] 
  this was a bug, fixed

- [2002-09-26 04:38:46 AM, ben]
  It would probably be easier to choose color with a #AARRBBGG format rather 
  than the current 4 float values one, wouldn't it ?

  [2002-09-27 04:12:26 PM, zig]
  I chose this because it was the parameters used into C side
  draw_poly_text and draw_poly_box ... Also I find easier
  to handle value between 0 and 1 than value between 0 and ff :)

  [2002-09-27 10:28:59 AM, ben]

+ [2002-09-26 06:18:36 PM, ben]
  Add commit and update target to Makefile

  [2002-09-27 10:35:11 AM, ben]
  Done. Currently `make commit' and `make update' depends on TODO target,
  which rebuild the TODO file (this file) with `[2002-09-27 10:35:11
  AM, ben]' substitution.

- [2002-09-27 10:46:59 AM, ben]
  Executing ke_shutdown() after a keyboard_emu() kills the keyboard emulator
  but do not give back controler control.

- [2002-09-29 02:49:07 AM, ben]
  drawing text bugs while console has not been displayed.

+ [2002-09-30 09:53:51 PM, ben]
  Prevent auto fullpath for options (string starting by '-').

  [2002-10-02 07:16:52 PM, ben]
  This is done. lua fullpath_convert() function have been modified to ignore
  all parameters beginning by '-' if no default arglist was given.

- [2002-09-30 10:15:41 PM, ben]
  Check for target is same than source in copy functions

- [2002-09-30 10:15:41 PM, ben]
  Add an fu_append function to file_utils.c

- [2002-10-02 04:43:11 AM, ben]
  50/60 hz test and selection

- [2002-10-02 06:38:39 AM, ben]
  Map show/hide console on emulated keyboard. Currently it is mapped
  on '`', but this is not really obvious...

-[2002-10-02 06:38:39 AM, ben]
  '%' char does not appear on emulated keyboard.

- [2002-10-02 07:16:28 PM, ben]
  Change VMU image.

- [2002-10-04 11:01:13 PM, ben]
  Add page up page down event

- [2002-10-08 06:30:04 AM, ben]
  Gui inactive mode does not seem to work.

+ [2002-10-08 11:00:19 AM, ben]
  Dirty display list. You can see it when you run a visual plugin.

  [2002-10-10 07:05:52 AM, ben]
  Fixed. It was just a clipping test I forgot to remove. :)

+ [2002-10-09 02:53:45 AM, ben]
  '%' char vanished ! May be it is KOS printf.

  [2002-10-10 04:33:12 AM, ben]
  Fixed. KOS use sprintf result with other printf functions. This makes '%'
  char vanish. I adds a dbgio_puts function and use it in printf.c file.

- [2002-10-09 02:53:45 AM, ben]
  dolib function makes dc reset sometime when nested. It is probably a bug with
  lua dofile() function.

- [2002-10-09 02:55:13 AM, ben]
  Add libpath parameter to dolib function (init.lua)

- [2002-10-10 07:05:52 AM, ben]
  SID auto detect end. Set a max time and an idle time (playing 0 sample).
