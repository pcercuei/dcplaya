** TODO :

- playlist load/save

- improve API to get information about currently played sound

+ controllers (joystick and keyboard) in separate thread

- VMU console

+ recall and line editor for shell

- lua binding to get driver informations

- lua binding to get song informations and play new songs

- calling d-tor

- add BUGS to cvs

+ Fix stereo bugs
  (2002/09/21 ben) I was probably really tired when I wrote this code. It seems
  to be fixed right now. Since I don't have a stereo output here, I can't
  really test it !!!

+ Load playlist
  (2002/09/20 ben) For m3u only.

- Load .pls playlist

- Save playlist

- cd() command should verify if the path exist and is a dir.

- md() command can't handle relatif path, can it ? --> NOT YET :)

- Look at the face-border rendering. Sometime some borders seem to be shifted.

- Japanese support (encoding / display)

+ Remove .gz for file detection
  (2002/09/21 ben) Extensions are properly discard in songmenu.c. It removes
  double extension `.xxx.gz' when building a music name.
  Input drivers that handle gzip loading, must add a new `.xxx.gz' extension
  for each `.xxx' handled. This could make the extension list a little longer
  specially for mikmod which handles lotsa.
  The inp_driver_list_search_by_extension() function must not be given an
  extension from filetype_ext() function because it does not handle properly
  .gz extension.

- Just a idea for later : Karaoke mode with jumping ball...

- Change info in inp plugin API. It is such a mess.

- Ignore joypad move when awaking browser display

- Don't make browser sleep when no visual ( or music playing ? )

- check sndstream functions parameters (frq, vol ... )

- Correct bug of hilight (see BUGS)

- Correct time bug. I Don't really remember what is the bug. Sommething like
  time is not ressetted when changing track in the same file (sc68/playsid).

- Encoding support : e.g Chris Huelsbeck

- Clipping !!! At least for the text window ! A scroller should be nice  when
  text becomes to long.

- Better support for multi track. Think to a supported-features flag in inp API
  and a get_tracks() function.

- File selected is desactivated when reload plugin (side effects of previous
  bug correction for filetype)

- Bug : Lock when killing app to earlier (e.g. while initializing ZED)
