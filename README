    CD browser
    ----------

     - Compatible ISO9660 mode 2 : 32 character long filename.
     - Change disk auto-detection. May be a little buggy :-( The disk may be
       changed at anytime. Select the <root> or any directory entry in file
       browser to read the new disk content. Sometime the new CD is not
       correctly detected. You should try the 'cache cleaning' trick : just
       select the [.] or [cd] entry when no music is playing. You can try it
       many times until it success. If it do not want to do it try to reboot
       your Dreamcast :-)
